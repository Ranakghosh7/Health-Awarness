         <h2>VITAMIN-D:</h2> <p>    This powerhouse vitamin reduces inflammation in the arteries and strengthens the skeleton, but all people, not just men, can be deficient in it because they don’t get enough ultraviolet B rays from the sun. Some foods that are rich sources of vitamin D include oily fish (like salmon), meat, eggs, dairy and mushrooms. Ask your doctor to test your vitamin D levels. <br>You can get vitamin D in a few different ways:  

            Sunlight:= This is why vitamin D is sometimes referred to as the “sunshine vitamin.” Your body can make vitamin D with exposure to sunlight. Keep in mind that this amount can vary based on geographic location, environmental conditions, sunscreen use, age, and skin color, so sunlight may not always be a reliable source of vitamin D.  
            <br><br>
            Food:= Vitamin D-rich foods include fatty fish (think salmon, mackerel, herring, or tuna), egg yolks, and liver. Unfortunately, few foods naturally contain vitamin D, but some are fortified with vitamin D, like milk and orange juice.  
            <br><br>
            Vitamin D supplements:= If you don’t think you get enough vitamin D through food and sunlight, you may consider taking a high-quality vitamin D supplement to make sure you get enough of this vital nutrient.    </p>
<br><br>
           <h2>MAGNESIUM:</h2> <p> This mineral is involved in more than 300 processes in your body. Low levels may increase your risk of heart disease. Studies say most men consume only about 80 per cent of the recommended daily magnesium. <br>  Navy beans and halibut are great sources of magnesium, but it can be hard to get all you need from food alone. Talk to your healthcare practitioner if you think you may be falling short </p>
           <br><br> <div class="col-2"><img src="men2.jpg" alt=""></div>
           <h2>VITAMIN B12:</h2>  <p> Good sources of vitamin B12 include meat, poultry, eggs, fish and shellfish, cheese, yoghurt and milk, and fortified cereals, but talk to your doctor about your levels </p>
<br><br>
            <h2> POTASSIUM:</h2><p>  This essential mineral helps your cells use glucose for energy. Many men don’t consume enough. Potassium works to lower sodium in the blood, so if your diet is high in sodium, have a chat to your doctor. Avocados, potatoes and bananas are all excellent sources </p>
<br><br> <div class="col-2"><img src="men3.jpg" alt=""></div>
           <h2>IODINE: </h2> <p> Your thyroid glands need iodine to produce the hormones T3 and T4, both of which help control how you burn calories. Insufficient levels may make you gain weight and feel fatigued. Eggs, milk and yoghurt are good sources of iodine, but talk to your doctor about your levels and what to do about them. </p>
                   <br><br>
            <h2>Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):</h2> <p>CoQ10 is a vitamin-like nutrient produced in the body and found in small amounts in food. CoQ10 plays an important role in energy production within the body, and may also help support heart health and male fertility.  </p>
            <br><br> <div class="col-2"><img src="men4.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <h2>Omega-3 Fatty Acids :</h2> <p>Commonly found in fish, nuts, and seeds, omega-3s help support brain, eye, heart, and immune health. EPA and DHA, two of the most researched types of omega-3 fatty acids, are a great source of heart-healthy unsaturated fats.  
<br>
                While there is no official adequate intake level for EPA and DHA, it’s clear that omega-3s are essential for overall health. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends eating two or more servings of a variety of fatty fish or seafood each week. 
                <br><br>
                For those who do not eat fatty fish regularly, a high-quality omega-3 fish oil supplement may be beneficial to help you get enough omega-3s. If you’re vegetarian, vegan, or allergic to fish, consider an algae-based omega-3 supplement instead.  </p>
                  <br><br> 
                  <h2>PROTEIN:</h2> <p>Along with carbohydrates and fat, protein is one of the big three macronutrients. <br>  It helps support healthy tissues and muscles throughout the body, plays an important role in immune health, and helps support satiety and a healthy weight.  <br>  There’s no shortage of protein sources – think lean meat, poultry, fish, nuts, beans, seeds, dairy, eggs, and tofu.  <br>  With so many great options, most men have no trouble getting enough protein from their diet. Although protein needs are different for everyone, adult men usually need around 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.  <br>  So, a 160-pound (72.7 kg) man would need about 58 grams of protein per day. Male athletes or those trying to build muscle may have higher protein requirements.  <br>   Talk with a registered dietitian if you’re curious about your own protein needs.  </p>                                   
<br><br> <br><br><br> <div class="col-2"><img src="men5.jpg" alt=""></div>
                <h2>VITAMIN C:</h2> <p>1.Boost Immunity By Helping White Blood Cells Function Better:
                    One of the main reasons to consume Vitamin C is regarded to the immunity boosting properties it provides. It helps encourage the production of white blood cells known as lymphocytes and phagocytes, that in turn helps protect your body against infections.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to the immunity boosting properties, vitamin C benefits the skin. It is an essential part of the skin’s defence system where acts as an antioxidant and helps strengthen the skin’s barriers.
                    <br><br>
                    Vitamin C also increases your blood antioxidant levels by up to 30% which aids the body's natural defences to fight inflammation.
                    <br><br>
                    Amla, also known as the Indian Gooseberry originates in India and contains a high concentration of Vitamin C along with a full-spectrum of immune-enhancing benefits, popularly known for supporting immunity, energy and optimal health. Fast&Up Charge supplement offers natural Vitamin C derived from Amla extract that is a well-known natural and rich source of Vitamin C with natural antioxidant properties.
                    <br><br>
                    2. Prevents The Common Cold:
                    Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps the immunity levels to stay strong. When it comes to common cold, the supplement shows the following effects:
                    <br><br>
                    Reduced cold severity: It reduced the intensity of the symptoms of cold, making it less severe.
                    Reduced cold duration: Supplements decreased recovery time by 8% in adults and 14% in children, on average.<br>
                     3. Strong Antioxidant That May Reduce The Risk Of Chronic Disease:
                    The antioxidant nature of Vitamin C can strengthen your body’s natural defences. It protects cells from harmful molecules called free radicals. When free radicals accumulate, they tend to promote a state known as oxidative stress, which has been linked to many diseases.
                    <br><br>
                    4. May Help Battle High Blood Pressure:
                    High blood pressure puts you at a risk of heart disease. Studies have shown that vitamin C may help lower blood pressure in those with and without a high blood pressure. Vitamin C supplementation has shown to help relax the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart through the entire body. This relaxation helped reduce blood pressure levels.
                    <br><br>
                    5. Reduces The Risk Factors Of Heart Diseases:
                    Heart disease is the number one cause of death worldwide. Many factors increase the risk of heart disease, including high BP, high levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol, low levels of “good” HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Supplementation may help reduce these risk factors, which may in turn reduce the risk leading towards a heart disease.
                    <br><br>
                    6. Could Help In Reducing Blood Uric Acid Levels:
                    Uric acid is a waste product that is produced by the body. At times this uric acid may crystallize and deposit in the joints at high levels. This condition is incredibly painful and involves inflammation of the joints. Interestingly, several studies have shown that vitamin C may help reduce uric acid levels in the blood and, as a result, help protect against gout attacks.
                    <br><br>
                    7. Helps In Improving Iron Absorption:
                    Iron is an important nutrient that has a variety of functions in the body such as red blood cells formation and oxygen transportation throughout the body.
                    <br><br>
                    Vitamin C supplements can help improve the iron absorption in your daily diet. Vitamin C assists in converting iron that is poorly absorbed, such as that from plant-based sources, into a form that is easier to absorb. If you suffer from low iron levels, consuming more vitamin C-rich foods or popping a vitamin C supplement may help improve your blood iron levels
<br><br>
                    where to get from :You can consume most of the vitamins from fruits and vegetables. Some vitamin C foods include tomato juice, potatoes, citrus fruit, kiwifruit, green peppers, red peppers, broccoli, Brussels, strawberries, and cantaloupe.  Most of the vitamin C content reduces while cooking or storing vitamin C foods. The reason is that ascorbic acid is a water-soluble acid and is easily destroyed by heat. Therefore, it is always recommended to consume many of the vitamin C foods in raw form to get most of the benefits of vitamin C.

                <h2>PHOSPHORUS:</h2><p>
                    Benefits of Phosphorus-  <br><br>
Phosphorus is a mineral that helps build strong bones and teeth;
It also helps release energy from food.  <br><br>
Sources of Phosphorus-  <br><br>
Red meat, fish, poultry;
Dairy foods, bread, brown rice, oats.  <br><br>
How much phosphorus is needed by an adult male?-  <br><br>
Adults need 550mg of phosphorus each day.
The daily requirement of phosphorus can be absorbed from a varied and balanced diet.
Taking 250mg or less a day of phosphorus supplements on top of the phosphorous absorbed from food is unlikely to cause any harm.  <br><br>

What happens if too much phosphorus is taken?-  <br><br>
Taking high doses of phosphorus supplements for a short time can cause diarrhoea or stomach pain.
Taking high doses of phosphorus for a sustained period can reduce the amount of calcium in the body, leading to a higher likelihood of bone fractures.

                <h2>VITAMIN K:</h2> <p>1. It Prevents Osteoporosis
                    Many post-menopausal men lose bone density as they age and end up developing osteoporosis. When left untreated, it can cause several complications, including spinal deformity, pain, and fractures. Men lose bone density after menopause mainly due to a reduction in the estrogen levels. Including vitamin K in your diet can help prevent this issue. You can do it by increasing your intake of collard greens, spinach, broccoli, lettuce, and other leafy veggies.
                    <br><br>
                    2. It Regulates Blood Clotting
                    Without enough vitamin-K in your system, your body will not be able to regulate blood clotting. That usually happens because vitamin K plays a role in amalgamation of prothrombium, which is a process that starts automatically when you sustain an injury and bleed. Vitamin K helps regulate blood-clotting mechanism by making it easier for calcium to circulate through the body. Getting enough vitamin K2 is also important to prevent myelodysplastic syndromes and other blood disorders.
                    <br><br>
                    3. It Lowers Risk of Internal Bleeding
                    Are there any other vitamin K benefits? Of course. As it helps blood clot, it also lowers your risk of internal bleeding, especially in the liver. Vitamin K also plays a role in preventing jaundice and poor nutrient absorption. It also helps prevent issues associated with your gastrointestinal system, including Crohn's disease, sprue, and colitis.
                    <br><br>
                    4. It Maintains Cardiovascular Health
                    By getting rid of any buildup of minerals in the arteries, vitamin K plays a bid role in regulating your blood pressure. It lowers blood pressure and relieves pressure from your heart. Mineralization occurs naturally with age and can lead to several types of cardiovascular complications, but vitamin K can lower that risk significantly.
                    <br><br>
