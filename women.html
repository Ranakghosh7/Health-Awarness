        <h3> 1. Folic acid (folate) and other B vitamins:</h3><p>How much you need: 400 micrograms (mcg) daily
            <br><br>
            Foods it’s found in: spinach, nuts, beans, orange juice; fortified foods such as bread, pasta, and breakfast cereal
            Your body needs this B vitamin to make new cells. During pregnancy, folic acid helps to form the neural tube that will develop into your baby’s brain and spinal cord.
            <br><br>
            Prenatal vitamins contain folic acid because it may help reduce the risk of having a baby with a brain or spinal cord defect. Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate and not all of it can be used by the body.
            <br><br>
            Folate is also necessary for red blood cell formation, and young women are at greater risk of developing folate-deficiency anemia.
            <br><br>
            It’s important to take this vitamin daily, even if you’re not planning to get pregnant. About half of all pregnancies are unplanned. A growing baby needs folic acid in the early weeks of pregnancy before many women realize they’re pregnant.
            <br><br>
            These other B vitamins are also important for energy production and cell growth:
            <br><br>
            B-1 (thiamine): from fortified cereal, pork, fish, beans, peas, and sunflower seeds<br><br>
            B-2 (riboflavin): from eggs, organ meats, breakfast cereals, and dairy foods<br><br>
            B-3 (niacin): from poultry, beef, and fish<br><br>
            B-6 (pyridoxine): from beef, fish, fortified cereals, and chickpeas<br><br>
            B-7 (biotin): from beef, fish, eggs, avocados, sweet potatoes, and nuts  </p><br><br>
        <h3>2. Iron </h3><p>How much you need: 18 mg daily
            <br><br>
            Foods it’s found in: lean meat, seafood, nuts, beans, vegetables, and fortified grain products
            Iron is an essential nutrient. Your body needs it for:
            <br><br>
            growth<br><br>
            transporting oxygen to your tissues<br><br>
            making certain hormones<br><br>
            Young women often have low levels of iron in their body either because of heavy periods or they get too little of this nutrient from their diet.
            <br><br>
            Iron deficiency can lead to anemia, which is when you don’t have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout your body.
            <br><br>
            While you do need iron, don’t overdo it. Excess iron can cause:
            <br><br>
            constipation<br><br>
            nausea<br><br>
            belly pain<br><br>
            vomiting<br><br>
            Iron is best absorbed when taken with vitamin C. Pairing a good source of iron, such as chicken or beans, with a Vitamin C source such as strawberries at a meal will maximize absorption.  </p><br><br>
            <div class="col-2"><img src="eathealthy.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <h3>3. Vitamin D </h3><p> How much you need: 600 international units (IU) daily <br><br>
            Foods it’s found in: fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel, fortified milk, cheese, and egg yolks
            Some of your supply of this vitamin comes from dairy foods like milk and cheese. The rest, your body makes when your skin is exposed to sunlight.
             <br><br>
            Up to 78% Trusted Source of women in their childbearing years are short on vitamin D. If you live in a northern climate and you don’t get much sun, you may need a supplement to make up for what you’re missing.
             <br><br>
            If you live in a more southern latitude and you wear sunscreen regularly, you may also be deficient.
             <br><br>
            Vitamin D works as calcium’s partner to promote healthy bones. It’s also involved in:
             <br><br>
            cell growth <br><br>
            immune function <br><br>
            reducing inflammation in the body <br><br>
            You don’t want to get too much of this nutrient, though. In very high amounts, vitamin D can raise blood levels of calcium. High calcium could damage your heart, blood vessels, and kidneys. </p><br><br>
        <h3> 4. Vitamin E</h3><p> How much you need: 15 mg daily <br><br>
            Foods it’s found in: nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils
            This vitamin is essential for a healthy immune system. Vitamin E is also an antioxidant that protects your body against the harmful effects of damaging molecules called free radicals.
             <br><br>
            That protective effect may help prevent problems getting pregnant, or delivering a healthy baby, research findsTrusted Source.
             <br><br>
            StudiesTrusted Source are looking at whether this vitamin can help with heart health and normal cell division.
             <br><br>
            There aren’t any risks when you get your vitamin E from food. But very high supplement doses could increase bleeding, especially if you’re already on a blood thinner like warfarin (Coumadin). </p><br><br>
            <div class="col-2"><img src="women1.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <h3> 5. Magnesium</h3><p>How much you need: 310 mg daily (ages 19 to 30); 320 mg (ages 31 to 50) <br><br>
            Foods it’s found in: Nuts, spinach, soy products, beans, peas, oats, wheat, barley, and dairy products
            Magnesium helps regulate many different chemical reactions in your body, including:
             <br><br>
            maintaining healthy blood sugar and blood pressure levels <br><br>
            keeping muscles and nerves working as they should <br><br>
            helping your body produce protein <br><br>
            It’s important to get enough of this nutrient, especially if you’re planning a pregnancy. Research showsTrusted Source most pregnant women are low in magnesium. Deficiencies in pregnancy are linked to problems like gestational diabetes, early delivery, and babies who are born too small.
             <br><br>
            Getting too much magnesium from your diet isn’t harmful, because your body removes any extra you consume. However, high doses of supplements could cause nausea and belly cramps.  </p><br><br>
        <h3> 6. Choline</h3><p> How much you need: 425 mg daily <br><br>
            Foods it’s found in: Meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, and eggs
            You need choline to keep your cells structurally sound. This essential nutrient also helps your body produce the chemical messenger acetylcholine, which is important for mood, memory, and muscle control.
             <br><br>
            Yet many young women, especially vegetarians, don’t get enough of this nutrient from their diet. Like folate, this has implications early in pregnancy. Talk with your healthcare provider about specific recommendations on choline supplementation if you’re planning to get pregnant.
             <br><br>
            Getting too much choline can cause side effects like a fishy body odor, as well as vomiting, excess sweating, and low blood pressure. </p><br><br>
            <div class="col-2"><img src="women2.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <h3> 7. Probiotics</h3><p> Probiotics aren’t nutrients, per se. They’re beneficial bacteria found in foods and supplements that offer a range of health benefits. Research about probiotics’ connection to health has boomed in recent years.
<br><br>

Including vitamin K in your diet can help prevent this issue. You can do it by increasing your intake of collard greens, spinach, broccoli, lettuce, and other leafy veggies.
        <br><br>
        2. It Regulates Blood Clotting
        Without enough vitamin-K in your system, your body will not be able to regulate blood clotting. That usually happens because vitamin K plays a role in amalgamation of prothrombium, which is a process that starts automatically when you sustain an injury and bleed. Vitamin K helps regulate blood-clotting mechanism by making it easier for calcium to circulate through the body. Getting enough vitamin K2 is also important to prevent myelodysplastic syndromes and other blood disorders.
        <br><br>
        3. It Lowers Risk of Internal Bleeding

<h2>VITAMIN C:</h2> <p>1.Boost Immunity By Helping White Blood Cells Function Better:
    One of the main reasons to consume Vitamin C is regarded to the immunity boosting properties it provides. It helps encourage the production of white blood cells known as lymphocytes and phagocytes, that in turn helps protect your body against infections.
    <br><br>
    In addition to the immunity boosting properties, vitamin C benefits the skin. It is an essential part of the skin’s defence system where acts as an antioxidant and helps strengthen the skin’s barriers.
    <br><br>
    Vitamin C also increases your blood antioxidant levels by up to 30% which aids the body's natural defences to fight inflammation.
    <br><br>
    Amla, also known as the Indian Gooseberry originates in India and contains a high concentration of Vitamin C along with a full-spectrum of immune-enhancing benefits, popularly known for supporting immunity, energy and optimal health. Fast&Up Charge supplement offers natural Vitamin C derived from Amla extract that is a well-known natural and rich source of Vitamin C with natural antioxidant properties.
    <br><br>
    2. Prevents The Common Cold:
    Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps the immunity levels to stay strong. When it comes to common cold, the supplement shows the following effects:
    <br><br>
    Reduced cold severity: It reduced the intensity of the symptoms of cold, making it less severe.
    Reduced cold duration: Supplements decreased recovery time by 8% in adults and 14% in children, on average.<br>
     3. Strong Antioxidant That May Reduce The Risk Of Chronic Disease:
    The antioxidant nature of Vitamin C can strengthen your body’s natural defences. It protects cells from harmful molecules called free radicals. When free radicals accumulate, they tend to promote a state known as oxidative stress, which has been linked to many diseases.
    <br><br>
    4. May Help Battle High Blood Pressure:
    High blood pressure puts you at a risk of heart disease. Studies have shown that vitamin C may help lower blood pressure in those with and without a high blood pressure. Vitamin C supplementation has shown to help relax the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart through the entire body. This relaxation helped reduce blood pressure levels.
    <br><br>
    5. Reduces The Risk Factors Of Heart Diseases:
    Heart disease is the number one cause of death worldwide. Many factors increase the risk of heart disease, including high BP, high levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol, low levels of “good” HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Supplementation may help reduce these risk factors, which may in turn reduce the risk leading towards a heart disease.
    <br><br>
    6. Could Help In Reducing Blood Uric Acid Levels:
    Uric acid is a waste product that is produced by the body. At times this uric acid may crystallize and deposit in the joints at high levels. This condition is incredibly painful and involves inflammation of the joints. Interestingly, several studies have shown that vitamin C may help reduce uric acid levels in the blood and, as a result, help protect against gout attacks.
    <br><br>
    7. Helps In Improving Iron Absorption:
    Iron is an important nutrient that has a variety of functions in the body such as red blood cells formation and oxygen transportation throughout the body.
    <br><br>
    Vitamin C supplements can help improve the iron absorption in your daily diet. Vitamin C assists in converting iron that is poorly absorbed, such as that from plant-based sources, into a form that is easier to absorb. If you suffer from low iron levels, consuming more vitamin C-rich foods or popping a vitamin C supplement may help improve your blood iron levels
<br><br>
    where to get from :You can consume most of the vitamins from fruits and vegetables. Some vitamin C foods include tomato juice, potatoes, citrus fruit, kiwifruit, green peppers, red peppers, broccoli, Brussels, strawberries, and cantaloupe.  Most of the vitamin C content reduces while cooking or storing vitamin C foods. The reason is that ascorbic acid is a water-soluble acid and is easily destroyed by heat. Therefore, it is always recommended to consume many of the vitamin C foods in raw form to get most of the benefits of vitamin C.
