             <h2> SYMPTOMS</h2>:=  <p> The symptoms of the disease can be mild in the beginning but can get severe over a period of time. It’s unlikely that two people with this disease experience exactly the same symptoms but there are some common indicators that may be experienced by all. Initial symptoms of the disease will include:
<br>
                - Memory lapses
                <br>
                - Losing everyday items such as keys, eye glasses

                - Forgetting common words in a conversation
                <br>
                - Losing way on familiar paths
                <br>
                - Forgetting conversations
                <br>
                The symptoms can get severe over a period of time and will begin interfering with the everyday life of the patient. They can get difficulties with the following:
                
                Language: Patients may repeat multiple times what they have already said and may fail to follow conversations
                
                Orientation: They may lose track of the time or day.
                
                Visuospatial: The patients may fail to understand space with respect to time. This can make climbing stairs or parking vehicles difficult.
                
                As the disease progresses and develops into a progressed case of Alzheimer’s, the patient may experience the following:
                
                Hallucinations: The patient can begin seeing and hearing things which do not exist.
                
                Unawareness of surroundings: The patient can become withdrawn and much less aware of what’s happening around them.
                
                Difficulty in everyday tasks: The patient will face difficulties in walking or eating on his own. Their increasing frailty will call for more support from others.    </p>

                Cholinesterase inhibitors approved for the symptomatic relief in the U.S. are Donepezil (Aricept), Rivastigmine (Exelon) and Tacrine (Cognex). Another drug used is memantine (Namenda), which is an NMDA receptor antagonist that can be used alone or in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor.
                
                Other therapy:-
                
                The need for quality of life care becomes more important as the person become less able to live independently.

            <br>
            <h2> TREATMENT </h2>:= <p>Medication:
<br>
                Painkillers: These will be prescribed to reduce pain but have no effect on inflammation.
                <br>
                Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs:
                <br>
                These are prescribed to reduce pain and inflammation.
                
                <br>
                
                Counterirritants:
                <br>
                Rubbing such creams or gels on the area of discomfort can provide temporary relief as they interrupt the transmissions of pain signals to the brain.
                <br>
                Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs:
                <br>
                These medicines stop the immune system from attacking the joints. This is prescribed in case of rheumatoid arthritis.
                <br>
                
                
                Biological response modifier:
                <br>
                These are genetically engineered drugs used in conjunction with DMARDs (Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs)to ensure that the immune system does not attack the joints.
                
                <br>
                
                Corticosteroids:
                <br>
                These reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. This may be prescribed to those with rheumatoid arthritis.
                
                <br>
                
                Therapy:
                <br>
                In order to ensure that you do not gain weight and keep building muscle to support your joints, seeking physical therapy also becomes necessary. In some cases of arthritis, certain exercises can help bring back your range of motion.
                
                <br>
                
                Surgery: In very extreme cases, surgery may be suggested. The kinds of surgery that you may have to go through are:
                <br>
                Joint repair: Sometimes, the surface of a joint can be smoothed over. This will reduce pain and increase range of motion.
                <br>
                Joint replacement: In this procedure, the joint is removed and replaced with an artificial one.
                <br>
                Joint fusion: Often used for smaller joints (like the ones in fingers), this procedure removes the ends of two bones in the joint. After which the ends are locked together so that they fuse as one singular unit.

                4.Resting
                <br>
                According to WHO, some of the immediate implementation of appropriate IPC measures include:
                <br>
                1. Give suspect patient a medical mask and send direct patient to a separate area or an isolated room.
                <br>
                2. Instruct all patients to cover nose and mouth during coughing or sneezing with tissue or flexed elbow for other.
                <br>
                3. Perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions.
                <br>
                4. When providing care in close contact with a patient with respiratory symptoms (e.g. coughing or sneezing), use eye protection (face-mask or goggles), because sprays of secretions may occur.
                <br>
                5. Limit patient movement within the institution and ensure that patients wear medical masks when outside their rooms.
                <br>
                6. Droplet and contact precautions prevent direct or indirect transmission from contact with contaminated surfaces or equipment (i.e. contact with contaminated oxygen tubing/interfaces).
                <br>
                7. Use PPE (medical mask, eye protection, gloves and gown) when entering room and remove PPE when leaving.

            <h3>Dengue</h3>
            <p> <h2> SYMPTOMS </h2>:=  <p>  The rare case when Dengue develops into a life threatening disease is referred to as Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever or Dengue Shock Syndrome. The former is characterized by Haemorrhage (severe bleeding), blood plasma leakage, and an exceptionally low platelet count. While, the latter occurs due to dangerously low blood pressure, which may lead to a circulatory collapse (shock).
<br>
                In many cases, especially in children there might be no symptoms or signs during a mild case of dengue fever. Sometimes when symptoms are mild and are mistaken for flu, it makes the case worse.

            <p> <h2> TREATMENT </h2>:= <p> While it is possible to detect the stage of Dengue infection at an early stage, there is no specific medicine to treat it. As per doctors, the only practical measures to treat Dengue is to use pain relievers, as suggested by your doctor. Drinking plenty of fluids and immunity boosting supplements can also help recharge the body. Taking enough rest also helps the body recover faster.

            <br>
            <p> <h2> TREATMENT </h2>:= <p> The classes of HIV/AIDS drugs include:

                Non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): This drug turns off the protein needed by HIV to multiply. Examples of the drug includes efavirenz (sustiva), etravirine (intelence) and nevirapine (viramune).
                Nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs): These are faulty versions of the of building blocks that HIV needs to make copies of itself. Examples of the drug includes Abacavir (Ziagen) and the combination drugs emtricitabine/tenofovir (Truvada), Descovy (tenofovir alafelnamide/emtricitabine) and lamivudine- zidovudine (combivir).
                Protease inhibitors (Pls): This is inactive HIV protease, which is another protein that HIV needs to make copies of itself. Examples include atazanavir (Reyataz), darunavir (Prezista), fosamprenavir (lexiva) and indinavir (crixivan).
                Entry or fusion inhibitors: It blocks HIV entry into CD4 T cells. Examples include enfuvirtide (fuzeon) and maraviroc (selzentry).
                Integrase inhibitors: The drug works by disabling a protein called integrase, which HIV uses to insert its genetic material into CD4 T cells. Examples include raltegravir (lsentress) and dolutegravir (tivicay).

<br>

            <h3>Hypertension or high blood pressure</h3>
            <p> <h2> SYMPTOMS </h2>:= <p> There are three main categories of hypertension: pre-hypertension, hypertension stage 1 and hypertension stage 2.
<br>
                - Some rare symptoms include frequent headaches, nose bleeding and short breath.
                <br>
                - In severe cases, hypertension may lead to vision loss, kidney failure, erectile dysfunction and loss of memory.
                <br>
                - Blood spots in eyes is also an uncommon symptom in people with high blood pressure or diabetes.
                <br>
                - Dizziness is one of the side effects of high blood pressure medication. But dizziness is not caused by high blood pressure. However sudden dizziness, loss of balance and problem in walking can be warning signs of stroke. High blood pressure is a leading risk factor for stroke.
                <br>
                - Many people do not seek care until the condition is very severe. This condition is known as malignant hypertension. In malignant hypertension, the diastolic blood pressure (lower number) increases up to 140 mm Hg.
                <br>
                - Hypertension may lead to peripheral arterial disease which causes leg pain while walking. Peripheral arterial disease is a condition in which plaque builds up in arteries and affects the blood flow in lungs due to which symptoms like numbness, aching or heaviness of legs may occur.
                <br>
                - Hypertension that occurs during pregnancy can be due to several reasons including being over 40 years of age, IVF or other pregnancy related issues, being overweight, inactive, having more than one baby (twins or more) in the womb, smoking and alcohol.
                <br>
                - If hypertension continues to be there after 20 weeks of pregnancy then problems like preeclampsia may arise. High blood pressure may lead to a premature birth of the baby and may require caesarian delivery.    </p>
            <br>
            <p> <h2> TREATMENT </h2>:= <p> If the blood pressure is slightly elevated then the doctor may suggest a few lifestyle changes.
<br>
                In case of the moderate spike, the risk of developing cardiovascular disease increases in 10 years and to prevent this from happening the doctor may prescribe your lifestyle change along with some medications.
                <br>
                If blood pressure levels reach 180/120 mm Hg or above, this is called sever case. An immediate change to the type of dosage of medication may be necessary.
                <br>
                You should regularly visit your doctor to get your blood pressure checked. Few of the drugs prescribed during high blood pressure are as follows:
                <br>
                -Thiazide diuretics
                <br>
                -Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
                <br>
                -Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)
                <br>
                -Calcium channel blockers
                
                
            </p>
            
<br>
<br>
<br>

            <h3>Jaundice</h3>
            <p> <h2> SYMPTOMS </h2>:= <p>  Jaundice occurs when the amount of bilirubin in blood shoots up beyond 2.5-3 mg/dL. This happens if the normal metabolism of excretion of bilirubin is not carried out properly. The failure can occur at three stages:
<br>
                Pre-hepatic: When the problem occurs before secretion to liver. Pre-hepatic causes include malaria, thalassemia, drugs, autoimmune disorders, etc.
                Hepatic: When the problem occurs within the liver. Hepatic causes include Hepatitis A, B, C, D, or E, liver cancer, cirrhosis, etc.
                Post-hepatic: When the problem occurs after secretion from liver. Post-hepatic causes include gallstones, cancer, etc   </p>
            <br>
            <p> <h2> TREATMENT </h2>:= <p> Jaundice, much like cholera and diarrhea is a condition which develops due to pre-existing health problems. Hence, the main action plan involves treating the problem which is leading up to the excessive build-up of bilirubin virus. Once a diagnosis is made, treatment can then be directed to address that particular condition, and it may or may not require hospitalization.
<br>
                The liver is well equipped to eliminate the toxins and virus from the body on its own. However, in severe cases, help is needed. To treat jaundice, doctors usually treat the underlying cause which usually are alcohol and drug abuse-related problems, liver damage or cirrhosis, gallstones or even anemia.
                <br>
                In some cases, medical treatment with intravenous fluids, medications, antibiotics, or blood transfusions may be required and if at all other prescribed medications are causing the problem, alternating it or discontinuing it altogether is advised.
                <br>
                In cases of newborns, where jaundice is common, though the disease goes away on its own, exposure to sunlight and getting Vitamin D may eliminate the condition and flush away the virus.
                <br>

            <h3>Leukemia</h3>
            <p> <h2> SYMPTOMS </h2>:= <p>   - Dizziness, constant fatigue: Dizziness and constant fatigue are one of the foremost symptoms of Leukemia. This is because your body’s bone marrow does not produce enough white blood cells which can severely affect your immunity. Hence, the constant feeling of dizziness and fatigue persists. Along with this, shortness of breath also occurs. Therefore, if you see yourself panting after climbing a set of stairs, it is not a good sign.
<br>
                - Fever: Prolonged fever can also be a major signal of Leukemia. If you have been getting high temperature for a while along with other symptoms like dizziness, lethargy and fatigue, you may be developing Leukemia and it is time for you to see your doctor.
                <br>
                - Frequent infections and bruising: Frequent infections and bruising should not be confused with regular issues like cold and cough. When your body becomes prone to infections and bruising, it means that your body has lost its power to fight back and heal fast. This is a very important symptom and should not be ignored.
                <br>
                - Weight loss: Sudden weight loss without starting any weight loss or diet plan may be your body’s way of telling you that its immunity is being challenged. Therefore, getting yourself tested if you see a rapid weight loss should be your first choice.
                <br>
                - Tiny red spotting or rashes on skin: When your body is damaged by cancer, it is difficult for your body to grow healthy cells again. This means that replenishment of old cells is difficult. This leads to red spotting, rashes or sometimes even pale skin.  </p>
            <br>
            <p> <h2> TREATMENT </h2>:= <p> Treatment plans for leukemia differ from patient to patient, depending on the age, stage and spread of the disease. It needs to be handled carefully since it impacts blood functioning. The correct course of treatment also depends upon whether cancer has spread to other parts of the body, including the nervous system as well.
<br>
                One of the most common treatment plans proscribed is chemotherapy to target and kill the leukemic cells. Single or combination of drugs are given which are either had as a pill or injected into the bloodstream. Targeted therapy also proves to be helpful in certain cases in attacking certain genes responsible for the cancer spread.
                <br>
                Radiation therapy, where X-rays are used to target and stop cancerous cells from growing back are also depended upon. Using supplements and medicines which help your immune system can also keep the body strong and alert.
                <br>
                In more complex procedures, stem cell transplants wherein the diseased organ (the bone marrow) is replaced with blood-forming stem cells from a healthy donor or from your own body to regrow the tissue. This, although helpful, requires certain criteria to be met.

                        <h3>Low blood pressure</h3>
                     <h2> SYMPTOMS </h2>:=  <p>  The signs and symptoms of low blood pressure are as follows:

<br>
                            Fainting in case of syncope
                        <br>    
                            Nausea
                           <br> 
                            Lack of concentration
                            <br>
                            Fatigue
                            <br>
                            Blurred vision
                            <br>
                            Dizziness or lightheadedness
                            <br>
                            
                            
                            However, extreme hypotension can result in a life-threatening situation. The signs and symptoms of this condition includes:
                            <br>
                            Rapid pulse rate
                            <br>
                            Weakness
                            <br>
                            Feeling of confusion, which mainly occurs in elderly people
                            <br>
                            Pale skin colour
                            <br>
                            Rapid, shallow breathing
                            <br>
                            
                            This condition requires immediate medical attention. In case you are suffering from consistent low blood pressure condition, you should definitely seek medical help. Also, you should keep a record of persistent signs and symptoms as this may help you in treatment.   </p>
                        <br>
                        TREATMENT:= <p> Low blood pressure condition usually presents no visible symptoms, unlike a high blood pressure problem. Hence, there is no one course of treatment is prescribed in this condition. If the patient only exhibits mild symptoms or signs, no treatment is required.
<br>
                            However, if symptoms are usually caused by another medication, the treatment plan involved alternating or changing the medication or even lowering the dose and observing the changes. The ultimate goal in the treatment plan is to make the blood pressure levels rise up and get the blood pumping again. There are also certain lifestyle changes you can make at home to improve your condition. Increasing your sodium content (increasing salt intake), increasing water intake can also help. Eating a protein-rich and low carb diet which fights signs of dizziness can also help.
                            <br>
                            In more severe cases, doctors prescribe the use of certain medications which improves blood volume and contracts blood vessels, improving blood pressure.

            <h3>LUNG CANCER</h3>
            <p> <h2> SYMPTOMS </h2>:= <p>   Consistent cough
<br>
                Coughing which lasts more than two weeks is an indication of something serious. Consistent coughing which gets worse at night must be reported to the doctor immediately.
                <br>
                Blood in cough
                <br>
                Coughing along with blood is a sure shot way to know that something is wrong inside your body. Even a small amount of blood must be taken seriously. If you are coughing for a few days, getting blood in it and experiencing the below given symptoms, then you must get yourself checked on priority.
                <br>
                Shortness of breath
                <br>
                Uneasy feeling while breathing or struggling to catch your breath without doing any physical exercise is a symptom of lung cancer. The problem is likely to intensify at night and might also erupt any time during the day without much physical exertion.
                <br>
                Unexplained weight loss
                <br>
                Losing weight without trying is probably one of the first symptoms which indicate problems with your body. If you are shedding pounds, without heavy exercise or dieting, then you must get alert. If weight loss is accompanied by the given symptoms, then you must get your lungs scanned.

                Chest pain
                <br>
                Another symptom of lung cancer is chest pain. This symptom is often accompanied by breathlessness. Pain while breathing or constant pain during the day is a symptom of lung cancer as well.
                <br>
                Chest congestion
                <br>
                This problem will probably intensify in the winter season and might make it really uncomfortable for you to breathe. Any kind of hoarseness while breathing, or congestion in the chest which doesn’t go away with usual medication is a sign of something worse.
                <br>
                Bone pain
                <br>
                Body pain which is more specifically related to bones might also occur in lung cancer patients. Any kind of unexplained bone pain, which is persistent and painful, must be immediately reported to the doctor.
                <br>
                If you experience a combination of the above given symptoms, then it is highly recommended that you consult your doctor. Chest scan and other body tests must be done in time to detect lung cancer at an early stage.  </p>
            <br>
            <p> <h2> TREATMENT </h2>:= <p> Chemotherapy- The most common method of treating cancer patients is chemotherapy. Chemotherapy refers to the administration of drugs that stop the growth of cancer cells by killing them or preventing them from dividing. Though the process is long and painful, it is quite effective in treating patients who are at the starting or middle stage of lung cancer.
<br>
                Radiation- Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells. This method is specifically used to target organ specific cancer and eliminate the cluster of cancer cells.

            <h3>Malaria</h3>
            <p> <h2> SYMPTOMS </h2>:= <p>  Symptoms of malaria can take around seven to 18 days to appear after the mosquito bites. This duration depends upon the type of Plasmodium parasite that has infected the person. In case of Plasmodium vivax infection, the symptoms may take more time to show up. But you will be shocked to know that sometimes, it can take up to one year for the symptoms to appear.
<br>
                In some types, the fever occurs in the cycle of 24 to 48 hours. When this happens, you have high fever followed by chills, sweating and fatigue. These symptoms may last up to 6 hours.
                <br>
                The initial symptoms of malaria are flu-like and that is why it is confused with flu. Some initial symptoms are:
                <br>
                - High fever
                <br>
                - Chills
                <br>
                - Headache
                <br>
                - Vomiting
                <br>
                - Sweat
                
                The most severe type of malaria which is caused by Plasmodium falciparum can lead to life-threatening conditions like organ failure.   </p>
            <br>
            <p> <h2> TREATMENT </h2>:= <p> 1. Artemisinin based combination therapies (ACTs)
<br>
                ACTs are the first line of treatment for malaria. There are different types of ACTs, examples include artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine. Each ACT is a combination of two or more drugs that work as an antimalarial drug.
                <br>
                2. Chloroquine phosphate
                <br>
                Chloroquine is used for treatment when there a parasite that is sensitive to the drug. In most parts of the world the malaria causing parasite are resistance to chloroquine. Thus, the drug is no longer an effective treatment.
                <br>
                Other common antimalarial drugs are:
                <br>
                - Combination of proguanil and atovaquone
                <br>
                - Doxycyline (monodox, vibramycin) with Quinine sulfate (Qualaquin)
                <br>
                - Mefloquine
                <br>
                - Primaquine phosphate
                <br>
                New antimalarial drugs are being researched and developed. There is a constant struggle between the evolving drug-resistant parasites and the search for new drugs. One malaria parasite has shown resistance to all the available antimalarial drugs.
                <br>

            <h3>Measles</h3>
            <p> <h2> SYMPTOMS </h2>:= <p>  The symptoms of this disease mostly appear 10 to 14 days after the person has been exposed to the virus. The symptoms of this disease include:
<br>
                Cough
                <br>
                Fever
                <br>
                Runny nose
                <br>
                Red eyes
                <br>
                Sore throat
                <br>
                White spots inside the mouth
                <br>
                Rashes
                <br>
                The largely spread skin rash is the main sign of measles, which can last up to 7 days. These rashes generally start to show on the head and then spread to other body parts.
                <br>
                The different stages of the disease include:
                <br>
                Incubation period: The first 10 to 14 days after one has been infected by the virus is the incubation period. There is no sign and symptom of the disease.
                <br>
                Mild measles: Measles usually starts with a mild to moderate fever, which is often followed by a persistent cough, runny nose, inflamed eyes, and a sore throat. This mild infection lasts for two or three days.
                <br>
                Rash: One gets rashes on the face first and then moves on to other body parts. Rashes are small red spots that are slightly raised. The skin appears blotchy red due to clusters of spots and bumps. The rashes then spread to the arms and feet and the temperature of the body also rises. The rash fades slowly from the body   </p>
            <br>
            <p> <h2> TREATMENT </h2>:= <p> There is no specific treatment for measles. One can manage the symptoms as antibiotics do not work on viral infections, unlike bacterial infections.
<br>
                Though there are interventions available for people who are infected by this virus. So that they get fewer infections and severity also lessens.
                <br>
                A vaccine for measles is given within 72 hours of getting exposed.
                <br>
                Taking of the dose, an immune protein named immunoglobulin that is to be taken within six days of the exposure.
                <br>
                It is important to consult a doctor who would guide you with proper medication and precautions that have to be taken.
                <br>
                One can also take antibiotics to treat any bacterial infection like an ear infection that is caused as a complication to the virus.
                <br>
                You can make some changes in your lifestyle that can also ease the symptoms like:
                <br>
                Take rest and avoid strenuous activities
                <br>
                Increase your intake of fluids
                <br>
                Use a humidifier
                <br>
                Do not strain your eyes
            </p>

            <h3>Monkey pox</h3>
            <p> <h2> SYMPTOMS </h2>:= <p>  It could take days or even weeks after exposure before one starts to experience symptoms. Flu-like symptoms, such as fever, chills, headache, muscle pains, lethargy, and swollen lymph nodes, are among the early indications of monkeypox.
<br>
                A rash frequently appears a few days later. The rash initially appears as unpleasant, flat, red bumps. These lumps develop into blisters that ooze pus. The entire procedure can take two to four weeks before the blisters crust over and fall off. Additionally, one might experience oral, vaginal, or anus sores.
                <br>
                Lesions can range in number from a few to several thousand. Lesions may combine in severe situations, causing big chunks of skin to flake off.
                <br>
                Monkeypox complications can include secondary infections, bronchopneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis, and corneal infections with subsequent vision loss.
                <br>
                Not all monkeypox patients have all of the symptoms. In fact, many instances in the ongoing 2022 outbreak aren't manifesting symptoms in the typical way. Only a few tumours, no enlarged lymph nodes, less feverish symptoms, and other abnormal symptoms make up this presentation. It is possible to possess it without realizing it. However, one can still infect people by extended close contact even if they don't exhibit many symptoms of the virus.   </p>
            <br>
            <p> <h2> TREATMENT </h2>:= <p> Monkeypox does not currently have an approved antiviral therapy. Although they haven't been researched as a monkeypox treatment, antiviral medications may be helpful. There are a number of investigational antivirals with effectiveness against monkeypox, however they can only be used in research studies.

               <br> There are several drugs that can be used to contain an outbreak and stop the illness from spreading. They consist of:
                <br>
                · Influenza vaccine (smallpox vaccine)
                <br>
                · Vaccinia immune globulin (VIG)
                <br>
                · antibiotics for viruses (in animals)
                <br>
                The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the smallpox vaccine is roughly 85% effective at preventing the emergence of monkeypox. Your symptoms may be minor if you get the monkeypox virus after receiving the smallpox vaccine as a child.

            <h3>Rabies</h3>
            <p> <h2> SYMPTOMS </h2>:=  <p> WHO estimates that close to 15 million people receive post-bite vaccination which alone prevents thousands of Rabies deaths worldwide.   </p>
            <br>
            <p> <h2> TREATMENT </h2>:= <p> Rabies shots include:
<br>
                - Rabies immune globulin is a fast-acting shot that prevents virus from infecting you. The injection is given near the area where the animal bit you and as soon as possible after the bite.
                <br>
                - A series of rabies vaccines is given to help your body identify and fight rabies virus. This vaccination is given in your arm. The four injections are given over a course of 14 days.
                <br>

            <h3>Swine flu</h3>
            <p> <h2> SYMPTOMS:=</h2>  <p> 1. Fever: Fever can go upto 100 degree Celsius. This is because human body is not designed to be immune to the virus that swine flu brings with it. If your fever prolongs for more than 72 hours, it is advised to get tested for swine flu once.
<br>
                2. Headache: Another major symptom of swine flu is if you have been infected with swine flu, you may get severe headache which may not vanish even after taking a medicine.
                <br>
                3. Diarrhoea: This is one symptom which separates swine flu from regular flu. If you have high fever accompanied by diarrhoea, then chances are it maybe swine flu.
                <br>
                4.Cough &amp; sneezing: The most common symptom of getting swine flu as it is highly contagious. If you experience coughing and sneezing right after coming in contact with an infected person, you may be having swine flu.
                <br>
                5. Fatigue and body aches: Fatigue and body aches are a common way of body’s immunity being challenged. This is because we start feeling weak and we feel drained. This is an important symptom as well because we often mistake this symptom for ‘feeling under the weather’and tend to ignore it.
                <br>
                6. Other than this, patients have also reported respiratory symptoms like shortness of breath with some leading to respiratory support such as being on a ventilator for breath.   </p>
            <br>
            <p> <h2> TREATMENT </h2>:= <p> Some of the most commonly used medicines to treat swine flu are antiviral medications like Tamiflu and Relenza, which have strong agents which target the viral cells and eliminate them.

                One important precaution patients must also take during recovery is to also limit the outdoor activity, especially if you are sick or in the presence of people who are sick. One should also increase the intake of vitamins and nutrients which boosts immunity.
                
                There are also some home remedies which can prove to be helpful. Having tulsi (basil) every morning can relieve you of the symptoms. Natural flu relievers like garlic, camphor, aloe vera can also help you.

                <br>
                Sore Throat
                <br>
                There are some complications that a patient might face. It includes:
                <br>
                Involuntary tightening of the vocal cords
                <br>

            <br>
            <p> <h2> TREATMENT </h2>:= <p> There is no specific cure for tetanus, it depends on the severity of the symptoms. It is treated with a variety of medications which are immediate and long-term. It typically concentrates on the complications and the symptoms.
<br>
                Medical care includes:
                <br>
                Hospitalisation
                <br>
                Immediate treatment with a medicine called human tetanus immune globulin (TIG)
                <br>
                Wound care
                <br>

                <br>
                Tetanus vaccinations
                <br>
                In some cases, a surgery called debridement is required to remove dead or infected tissue. In severe cases, the patient is put on life-support to help them breathe.

                <br>
                Symptoms of TB may vary widely depending on which area of the body is infected. Different TB types and their symptoms are as follows:
                <br>
                - Someone with TB in lymph nodes may have a swollen throat.
                <br>
                - TB in the bones can cause aches and pain in the joints and bones.
                <br>
                - TB meningitis often has symptoms like severe headaches, vomiting, dislike of lights, neck stiffness and seizures.
                <br>
                - Spinal TB is also known as TB spondylitis or pott disease. The symptoms of pott disease depend on the stage of disease, and the affected site, but back pain is the earliest and most common symptom in this case.
                <br>
                - Gastrointestinal TB is also called as abdominal TB. Symptoms of abdominal TB can be abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and bleeding from the anus or rectum.  </p>
            <br>
           <h2>TREATMENT:=</h2> <p>  Three treatment options are available for Latent TB:
                
<br>
                Isoniazid (INH): This antibiotic is prescribed for 9 months.
                <br>
                Rifampin: This is four months course of medication.
                <br>
                Isoniazid and rifapentine: Both of these antibiotics are prescribed to some people suffering from latent TB.
                <br>
                For active TB antibiotics are prescribed for 6 to 9 months. The four common medications include:
                <br>
                -Ethambutol
                <br>
                -Isoniazid
                <br>
                -Pyrazinamide
                <br>
                -Rifampin
                <br>
                It is very crucial to complete the full course of drugs prescribed by the doctor. Stopping treatment too soon can allow the bacteria to become resistant to those drugs and can cause grave danger to the health.

                <br>
                In serious cases, where the patient is left untreated, typhoid can cause the bowels to become perforated. Through this, there is a 5-62% chance that the patient would develop another abdominal internship known as peritonitis.
                <br>
                Some people can harbour the arterial but they are asymptomatic. In some cases, the bacteria can remain in the body even after healing from the infection. There are also a few cases of typhoid infection returning in the body. People who have been diagnosed with the infection are recommended to stay at home and quarantine themselves till they have healed completely.  </p>
            <br>
             </h2> TREATMENT:=</h2> <p> Taking a good rest and isolating yourself is very important. Maintaining good personal hygiene by regularly washing hands with soap and water.
<br>
                If in case the patient is admitted to the hospital due to severe symptoms, antibiotic injections and nutrition through a drip is given to the patient. Surgery is also conducted if the patient develops certain life-threatening complications like internal bleeding. However, this is very rare. Under hospital care, patients tend to recover within three to five days.
                <br>
                In slight cases, the symptoms may reoccur. This is known as a relapse. In this case, you should reach out to your doctor and continue treatment.
                <br>
                Even after you have recovered from the infection, you may experience weeks of fatigue from the impact. It is essential to take things slow and rest.

Increasing water intake, taking immunity-boosting supplements and having flavanoid-rich drinks help recharge the body. ORs (Oral Rehydration Salts) also fill up the body with salts and electrolytes. They can also cut down on the duration the illness strikes the body.

                Patients are also prescribed antibiotics to fulfill the fluid requirements and also flush out remaining toxins and germs from the body. In the case of small children, zinc treatment also shows effective results.

                <br>
                Hunger pangs- Your body is not able to convert food into energy due to lack of insulin, which carries sugar to the cells and produces energy. When we are low on energy we feel hungry more often.
